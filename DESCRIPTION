Description: This package provides a set of R classes to dowload Open Targets
    data using the REST API. It is writtent using R Reference Classes and these
    classes have methods that return either lists, data frames vectors or JSON.
    Client code instantiates the classes and calls their methods to return the
    desired data. The types of data that can be returned are information for a given
    target (gene), disease, data supporting the association between a given target-
    disease pair, individual evidence data points linking the gene and disease or
    the underlying JSON evidence documents themselves. These are all explained in
    the test code.
