# Open Targets

[Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/) resource is for biomedical researchers who need to identify a biological target for a new therapy. It is a public-private initiative to generate evidence on the validity of therapeutic targets based on genome-scale experiments and analysis. Open Targets is working to create an R&D framework that applies to a wide range of human diseases, and is committed to sharing its data openly with the scientific community.

The *ropentargets* R package implements an R client to query the Open Targets REST API. To learn more about the
Open Targets REST API, please read [this blog](https://blog.opentargets.org/api-getting-started-1/) where the 
functionality and type of data that can be returned are described in detail. The REST API client described here allows R users to download the data into R data structures where it can be integrated with data gathered from other
R resources such as [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).

# Examples

## What data types and data sources are in the current version of the platform?

Open Targets integrates data from different sources into data types. The class *DataStats* provides methods to retrieve these counts as shown here:

```r
# Import the package.
library(ropentargets)
# Create an instance of the class.
restStats <- ropentargets::DataStats$new()
# What data types are available?
datatypeNames <- restStats$getDataTypeNames()
# Print the vector of data types.
print(datatypeNames)
print(restStats$getDataTypeListByName("rna_expression"))
```
